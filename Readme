Hi Team,
Thanks for giving me an opportunity to overcome the above challenging task, I have Pick up Azure as Cloud Provider to Use Virtual machine service in Azure and created App registration for API permission to integrate Grafana.
I have basic knowledge on ELK stake so couldn’t create the stake Automation where I have good knowledge on Azure ELK stake, where I worked for a customer in extracting web logs and application insights for ML project.
I couldn’t perform the authorized steps in short time so I have made small setup using Ansible , Jenkins  and Terraform to setup the three tier Application where there is no database involved if you find my inputs are correct give me some more time so that I can modify the Automation script in order to implement an application server and SQL database so that both can talk and give the better insights.

Thanks & Regards,
Vinayaka Murthy
